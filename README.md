## My thought process

### Creating a project

As I understand main goal of this recruitment process is to know candidate. So I decided to write here my thoughts.
    
At start, I initiated project and added git. Then created project structure and required classes. There are finite amount
of countries with clearly defined names, so putting them in the enum class seems to be the most logical decision,
at least in terms of my code exercise. For real project I could add all ~200 countries,
but for code exercise demonstration purposes I guess countries from example will be enough. 
For clean code purposes I added lombok to project to avoid writing boilerplate code.
